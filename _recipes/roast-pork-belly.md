title: Roast Pork Belly
source: "[Ottolenghi](http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/roasted-pork-belly-shop)"
tags:
 - roast
 - meat
category: main
cuisine: english
serves: 6-8
ingredients:
 - 1 bunch of thyme
 - 1 bunch of rosemary
 - 1 head of garlic
 - 150ml olive oil
 - 1 piece of pork belly (2–3kg)
 - 1 bottle of white wine
 - sea salt
 - black pepper
method:
 - Turn on the oven to 250°C or its highest setting
 - Blend the herbs, garlic and olive oil to a paste
 - Lay the pork belly in an oven tray, skin-side down, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Spread the herb mixture evenly all over the top, pressing it on so it sticks to the meat.
 - Turn the belly skin-side up, wipe the skin dry with kitchen paper and sprinkle sea salt evenly all over the skin (but don’t put too much on, as it might create a crust and prevent the crackling forming). Roast for 1 hour, turning the tray around every 20 minutes.
 - Once the skin has formed some crackling, turn the oven down to 170°C, pour the white wine into the tray (avoiding the pork skin) and roast for another hour. If the skin starts to burn, cover it with foil.
 - Turn the oven down to 110°C and roast for another hour, until the skin has crackled completely and thoroughly dried.
 - Remove the pork from the oven and cut into strips. Serve with [rhubarb and ginger relish](/spiced-plum-ginger-rhubarb-relish/)
