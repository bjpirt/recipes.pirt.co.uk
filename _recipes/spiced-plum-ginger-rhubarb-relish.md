serves: unknown
ingredients:
 - 5 red plums (about 240 g), stoned and cut into quarters
 - 1 red chilli, halved and seeded
 - 2 cinnamon sticks
 - 1 star anise
 - 100 ml red wine vinegar
 - 200 g caster sugar
 - 4 stalks of rhubarb (about 200g), cut into 3 cm lengths
 - a small knob of fresh ginger, chopped fine
method:
 - Heat the oven to 150 C. [325 F]. Place the plums and chilli in a heavy-based saucepan and add the cinnamon, star anise, vinegar and half the sugar. Stir well, bring to a light boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming any froth from the surface if necessary. The plum should have a jam-like consistency. To check this, chill a saucer, put a teaspoonful of the chutney on it, then run your finger through it; it should stay separated. Remove from the heat and leave to cool
 - While the plums are simmering away, place the rhubarb, ginger and remaining sugar in an ovenproof dish. Rub them together with your hands and place in the oven. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the rhubarb is tender. Remove from the oven and leave to cool
 - Combine the plums and rhubarb and mix well, remove the chilli, then transfer to a jar and leave to cool. Either serve the relish straight away or store in the fridge, where it will keep for a week or two
